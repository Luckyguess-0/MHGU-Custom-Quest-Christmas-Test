# MHGU-Custom-Quest-Christmas-Test
I decided to test out my questing tools (read: rush them out the door) by making some custom quests for our lan play servers MHGU Christmas revival. 
I have a couple quests planned, as well as, maybe some custom armor and weps.
I just got back from a big job so I'll be adding to it over time.
The event item is already implemented.

The quests will be for multiple people in endgame gear so expect monsters to be strong :)
 
If you're playing online make sure everyone is using the same mods, and knows your using mods. 
 
 
Yes, I will do an egg quest donâ€™t worry.
