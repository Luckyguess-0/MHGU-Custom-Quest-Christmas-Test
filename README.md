# MHGU-Custom-Quest-Christmas-Test
I decided to test out my questing tools (read: rush them out the door) by making some custom quests for our lan play servers MHGU Christmas revival. 
I have a couple quests planned, as well as, maybe some custom armor and weps.
I just got back from a big job so I'll be adding to it over time.
